I'll be there
When you feel lonely and frightened,
When you need help with something,
When you feel hopeless.

I'll be there
When you feel betrayed by someone you trusted,
When you feel broken-hearted,
When you are in difficult times.

I'll be there
When you fall, When you need a hug,
When you need some love.

I'll be there.
No matter what happens,
I'll be there.
